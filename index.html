                        New York City’s public school system has the potential to be a model of diversity.  The 1.1 million children who attend school in New York City are a mirror image of the largest school district in the country - 41 percent are Latino, 26 percent black, 17 percent Asian and 15 percent white.  The same can be said of the socio-economic background of these students with the median household income in New York City falling around $48,000.  

    However, the harsh reality is that New York City public schools are the most segregated in the country, both racially and economically.  In 2010, only 20% of school districts across the metro area were considered diverse, with half of the city’s white students concentrated into just seven percent of schools.  Even more starkly, nearly half of public school students were considered low-income in 2010.  Despite this, the typical white student attended a school where less than 30% of classmates were low-income, while the typical black or Latino student attended a school were close to 70% of classmates were low-income.

    These numbers matter.  While New York City is trying to close the achievement gap by improving traditional public education and increasing choice with charter schools, it is ignoring the simple fact that it is perpetuating a separate and unequal system.  


    Brooklyn Independent is a 5-8 middle school created by educators in response to the unequal and limited education opportunities available to families in Brooklyn.  Brooklyn Independent believes in the power of diversity and is committed to maintaining a student body that reflects Brooklyn– both socio-economically and racially.  


    Diversity Matters

    In the past few decades, segregation in American schools has taken a back seat to the achievement gap.  The national outcry around failing schools has led to various reforms including “reducing class sizes, creating smaller schools, raising academic standards, and encouraging more minority students to take high-level courses. Still, progress in reducing academic divides has been slow or nonexistent.”

    While the nation focuses on school resources, the data consistently shows that race and class continue to be the biggest factors in the academic disparity of our country.  New York City schools are as segregated as ever and our efforts continue to isolate and impede the success of our most vulnerable students.  In 2014, the graduation rates for students who were black and Latino was 20 percent lower than their white peers.  

    Diversity matters to all students.  Studies have found that with segregated schools “both minorities and whites are disadvantaged… The harms to minorities are primarily academic; the harms to whites are social and academic.” Attending an integrated school, most importantly, prepares all children to “navigate the multicultural world and global economy they will face upon graduation.” Time and time again, we find that “diversity makes us smarter.”

    Diversity has a larger impact on society.  When students attend a diverse school, they are 10% more likely to graduate from high school and when a person graduates from high school, this saves taxpayers $209,200 over the course of their lifetime. In addition, when black students attend a diverse school they increase their lifetime wages by 15%. 

    Diversity is something Americans value in higher education and business.  On college campuses, research has shown that “exposure to other students who are different from themselves and the novel ideas and challenges that such exposure brings lead to improved cognitive skills, including critical thinking and problem solving.” In addition, businesses have found that more diverse teams and leadership result in better ideas and innovation.  As cited in recent U.S. Supreme Court cases on affirmative action, “nearly half of the companies in the Fortune 100 signed a brief testifying that it is an ‘economic imperative’ in the global economy to hire diverse employees with cross-cultural skills that only diverse educational settings can provide.” 

    The apparent benefits of diversity have led college campuses and businesses to commit themselves to creating and maintaining diversity among their students and employees.  So why are we waiting until adulthood to reap the benefits of diversity?

                    Brooklyn Independent aims to be centrally located in the Gowanus area in order to meet the growing demand for middle schools in district 13 and 15.  Due to an increase in population, up 3.5% since 2011, middle schools in the surrounding area are overcrowded and there is a need for diverse and rigorous schools in the community.  

                    In addition, the neighborhoods surrounding the Gowanus (Park Slope, Carroll Gardens) has an average household income twice that of the borough of Brooklyn and families are willing to pay the private school tuition, with 30% of children currently attending private school.  The surrounding areas are also rich in opportunities to provide students with extracurricular activities with 199 arts and culture organizations.

                    The Gowanus is an ideal neighborhood due to its proximity to Park Slope and Carroll Gardens.  In addition, because it is not as developed as those neighborhoods we can find a location where rent is more attainable - a 5,000 square foot building in the Gowanus goes for $2-5 per square foot.

                    The Gowanus offers a rich network of community resources.  We will reach out to the following organizations/ people in order to build support for Brooklyn Independent:

                    <b>Kelsey Jones</b> has worked in education over the past 10 years and cannot wait to be a founding member of Brooklyn Independent.  Originally from San Diego, Kelsey earned a BS in Management and Accounting from the University of Wisconsin – Madison.  Instead of entering the business world, Kelsey was more invested in making a more profound difference on people’s lives and ended up in New York City with Teach For America.  Kelsey worked in Harlem for 3 years, earning her Masters in Secondary Math at Pace University and a Masters in Educational Leadership, Policy and Advocacy at NYU.  Kelsey joined Uncommon Schools in 2010 as a founding teacher with Ocean Hill Collegiate.  During her six years, Kelsey has taught grades 5-8, written a math curriculum for all four grades, been a Grade Level Leader for four years and an Instructional Leader for 4 years.  Kelsey’s biggest accomplishment as a teacher, though, was teaching the founding class for their four years at OHC and watching them become successful students and exceptional young adults.  Kelsey is thrilled to bring her love of math and teaching to Brooklyn Independent.

Kelsey worked in Harlem for 3 years, earning her Masters in Secondary Math at Pace University and a Masters in Educational Leadership, Policy and Advocacy at NYU.  Kelsey joined Uncommon Schools in 2010 as a founding teacher with Ocean Hill Collegiate.  During her six years, Kelsey has taught grades 5-8, written a math curriculum for all four grades, been a Grade Level Leader for four years and an Instructional Leader for 4 years.  Kelsey’s biggest accomplishment as a teacher, though, was teaching the founding class for their four years at OHC and watching them become successful students and exceptional young adults.  Kelsey is thrilled to bring her love of math and teaching to Brooklyn Independent.
