                        Kelsey Jones and Gabriela Tejedor are both current leaders and educators with Uncommon Schools-Brooklyn. They have a combined 15 years of teaching experience and created Brooklyn Independent in response to <b>the unequal and limited educational options available to diverse families</b> in Brooklyn.
                        <br><br> 
                        Brooklyn Independent is a (5-8) private middle school that authentically immerses students - both racially and socioeconomically by reflecting the diversity of Brooklyn. We provide an educational program that balances rigorous exploratory learning with an individualized exposure plan to prepare students to be successful at the top northeast high schools and beyond. Our school model is founded on four principles: rigor, exposure, racial and socio-economic immersion, and social-emotional learning.
                        <br><br>
                        Brooklyn Independent is slated to open September 2017 with a founding class of 40 students.

                    <b>Kelsey Jones</b> has worked in education over the past 10 years and cannot wait to be a founding member of Brooklyn Independent.  Originally from San Diego, Kelsey earned a BS in Management and Accounting from the University of Wisconsin – Madison.  Instead of entering the business world, Kelsey was more invested in making a more profound difference on people’s lives and ended up in New York City with Teach For America.  Kelsey worked in Harlem for 3 years, earning her Masters in Secondary Math at Pace University and a Masters in Educational Leadership, Policy and Advocacy at NYU.  Kelsey joined Uncommon Schools in 2010 as a founding teacher with Ocean Hill Collegiate.  During her six years, Kelsey has taught grades 5-8, written a math curriculum for all four grades, been a Grade Level Leader for four years and an Instructional Leader for 4 years.  Kelsey’s biggest accomplishment as a teacher, though, was teaching the founding class for their four years at OHC and watching them become successful students and exceptional young adults.  Kelsey is thrilled to bring her love of math and teaching to Brooklyn Independent.

She received her BA degree from New York University’s Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development and her Masters in Teaching from Relay Graduate School. During her time at NYU, she spent four years as both a Lead Teacher and NYU Chapter Founder with the organization Artists Striving to End Poverty, a non-profit committed to exposing at-risk youth to the arts in both in the U.S. and around the world as a means to foster critical thinking and break the cycle of poverty. As a Teach for America Greater Newark Corps Member, she wrote ELA Curriculum while teaching 3rd and 4th grade at Community Charter School in Paterson.

With her work at the NYC Department of Education, she assisted with development of the communications platform for the technology non-profit, School of One, named by Time Magazine as one of the “100 Best Innovations of 2009.” While living in Accra, Ghana she taught at La Enobal Secondary School developing original curriculum and creating an after school arts enrichment program through a grant from NYU Global Studies Program. During her time with Uncommon Schools, she taught 7th Grade Reading, was the Curriculum Specialist for 7th Grade Brooklyn Uncommon Schools, and worked as the Grade Level Leader.
